            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>That guy on the right, yeah that's me. I am Bailey Wickham, a programmer and a student at Cal Poly majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Math and Chinese. I love space, running, art, longboarding, music, skiing, programming and traveling. Along with classes, I am working on software for Polysat, Cal Poly's cube satelite lab.</p>
            <p>This site is built on top of a Dockerized Django instance, all behind a Nginx reverse proxy. Overly complicated, yes, but it was still fun to make. The source code is availble <a href="https://github.com/baileywickham/djangoProject">here</a>, including the deploy scripts.
